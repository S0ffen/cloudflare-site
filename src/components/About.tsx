            I first discovered programming at 16 — it started as a hobby, but
            quickly turned into a passion. The ability to build something from
            nothing using just code captivated me early on. Over time, I
            sharpened my skills by building websites, experimenting with
            different technologies, and pushing myself to solve increasingly
            complex problems.

            Nowadays, I’m working as a Fullstack Developer, focusing on the
            development of Building Management Systems (BMS) for applications
            like heat pump control and building automation. My daily stack
            includes C#, Blazor, Javascript, .NET, PostreSQL, MQTT — on my free
            time, I continuously improve my skills with React, Next.js,
            Javascript and Typescript. I actively contribute to internal tools
            and open-source side projects, always aiming to deliver clean,
            scalable, and maintainable code.

            I’m driven by constant learning and challenges that push me out of
            my comfort zone. Looking ahead, I see myself deepening my expertise
            in full-stack development, exploring cloud-native systems, and
            contributing to products that solve real-world problems. My goal is
            simple: to create software that’s not just functional, but
            impactful.
